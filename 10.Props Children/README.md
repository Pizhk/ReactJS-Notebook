# React Children ðŸ‘»

The most obvious and common prop that developers work with within React is the <code>children</code> prop. In the majority of cases, there is no need to understand how the <code>children</code> prop looks like. But in some cases, we want to inspect the <code>children </code>prop to maybe wrap each child in another element/component or to reorder or slice them. In those cases inspecting how the <code>children</code> prop looks like becomes essential.

You can use props.children in React in order to access and utilize what you put inside the open and closing tags when you are creating an instance of a component.

For example, if I have a Button component, I can create an instance of it like this: ```<Button>```HI!```<Button>``` and then inside of the Button component, I could access that text with props.children. You can also use this to create components that wrap other components ```<Container><Button /></Container>``` for example.


```jsx
function Button (props) {
  return <button>{props.children}</button>
}
```
