# React Terms ðŸ“’

- ## Single-page Application [SPA] ðŸŸ 
A single-page application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets (such as JavaScript and CSS) required for the application to run. Any interactions with the page or subsequent pages do not require a round trip to the server which means the page is not reloaded.

Though you may build a single-page application in React, it is not a requirement. React can also be used for enhancing small parts of existing websites with additional interactivity. Code written in React can coexist peacefully with markup rendered on the server by something like PHP, or with other client-side libraries. In fact, this is exactly how React is being used at Facebook.

- ## ES6, ES2015, ES2016, etc ðŸ”´

These acronyms all refer to the most recent versions of the ECMAScript Language Specification standard, which the JavaScript language is an implementation of. The ES6 version (also known as ES2015) includes many additions to the previous versions such as: arrow functions, classes, template literals, let and const statements. You can learn more about specific versions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions">here</a>.

- ## Compilers ðŸŸ¤
A JavaScript compiler takes JavaScript code, transforms it and returns JavaScript code in a different format. The most common use case is to take ES6 syntax and transform it into syntax that older browsers are capable of interpreting. <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> is the compiler most commonly used with React.

- ## Bundlers ðŸŸ¡
Bundlers take JavaScript and CSS code written as separate modules (often hundreds of them), and combine them together into a few files better optimized for the browsers. Some bundlers commonly used in React applications include <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> and <a href="https://browserify.org/">Browserify</a>.

- ## Package Managers ðŸŸ¢
Package managers are tools that allow you to manage dependencies in your project.<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> and <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> are two package managers commonly used in React applications. Both of them are clients for the same npm package registry.

- ## CDN ðŸ”µ
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. CDNs deliver cached, static content from a network of servers across the globe.
