# React Hooks üé£

React Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows developers to add state and other React features to functional components. Prior to the introduction of hooks, state management and other complex logic could only be implemented in class components using lifecycle methods. With hooks, developers can now write more concise and reusable code by leveraging functions instead of classes.

Hooks provide several benefits in React development. Firstly, they simplify the management of component state. With the "useState" hook, you can add state to a functional component, eliminating the need for a class-based component. This results in cleaner and more readable code.

Secondly, hooks enable the reuse of logic across components. The "useEffect" hook allows you to perform side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM after rendering. By encapsulating such logic in a custom hook, you can easily share it across different components, improving code maintainability and reducing duplication.

Another advantage of hooks is the ability to create custom hooks. Custom hooks are functions that combine multiple built-in hooks and encapsulate complex logic into reusable units. This promotes code modularity and makes it easier to share code between projects or within a team.

Here is a list of some commonly used React hooks:


- **<a href="#useState">useState</a>:** Manages state within functional components.
- **<a href="#useEffect">useEffect</a>:** Performs side effects after rendering, such as data fetching or subscriptions.
- **<a href="#useCallback">useCallback</a>:** Memoizes a function to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of components that depend on it.
- ```useContext```: Accesses the value of a React context.
- ```useReducer```: Alternative to useState for managing complex state logic.
- ```useMemo```: Memoizes a value to prevent expensive computations on every render.
- ```useRef```: Creates a mutable ref object that persists across renders.
- ```useLayoutEffect```: Similar to useEffect but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.
- ```useImperativeHandle```: Customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref.
- ```useDebugValue```: Provides a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.

These hooks cover a wide range of functionality and help streamline the development process in React. 
Below, we'll dive into each React hook in more detail. Let's start exploring each hook and its specific use cases:


<div id="useState"></div>

## useState üü§
The useState hook is a built-in hook provided by React that allows you to add state to functional components. With this hook, you can create and manage state variables within a functional component, giving it the ability to hold and update data.

The syntax for using useState is as follows:
```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```
Let's break down this syntax:

```state``` represents the current value of the state variable.
```setState``` is a function that allows you to update the state variable.
```initialValue``` is the initial value of the state variable.
Now, let's explore some examples to understand how useState works:

Example 1: Counter

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
In this example, we create a state variable called count and initialize it with 0 using useState(0). The setCount function is used to update the count variable. When the "Increment" button is clicked, the increment function is called, which increments the count by 1. The updated value is then reflected in the component's rendering.

Example 2: Input Field

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const InputField = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setText(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={text} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Typed text: {text}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```
In this example, we create a state variable called text and initialize it with an empty string using useState(''). The setText function is used to update the text variable whenever the input field's value changes. The onChange event handler is called, which invokes handleChange and updates the text state with the typed value. The typed text is then displayed below the input field.

These examples demonstrate how useState enables you to add and manage state in functional components. By using the setState function, you can update the state variable, triggering a re-render of the component and reflecting the updated state in the UI.

Remember that you can use multiple useState hooks within a single component to manage multiple independent state variables. Each state variable will have its own corresponding setState function.


<div id="useEffect"></div>

## useEffect ‚ö™Ô∏è
*useEffect* is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects can include things like fetching data from an API, subscribing to events, or updating the document title. It's called a "side effect" because it doesn't directly affect the rendering of your component, but rather deals with other interactions outside of it.

Here's a breakdown of how to use useEffect:

Import the useEffect hook from the React library:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
```
Use the useEffect hook inside your functional component:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effect code goes here
  });

  return (
    // JSX code for your component
  );
}
```

The first argument of useEffect is a function that will be called after the component renders. This function is where you can place your side effect code. It runs every time the component renders by default.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code
});
```

You can also provide a second argument to useEffect that determines when the effect should run. This is an optional array of dependencies. If any of the dependencies change between renders, the effect will be triggered again. If the dependency array is empty, the effect will only run once when the component mounts, and not again.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```
Now let's look at some examples:

1. Fetching data from an API:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      // Do something with the fetched data
    });
}, []);
```
In this example, the effect runs only once when the component mounts because the dependency array is empty.

2. Subscribing to an event:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    // Handle the click event
  };

  window.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
  };
}, []);
```
Here, the effect adds an event listener for the click event when the component mounts, and removes it when the component unmounts. The empty dependency array ensures that the effect only runs once.
