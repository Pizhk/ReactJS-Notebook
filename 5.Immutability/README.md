# Immutability in React ðŸ“Œ

One of the first things you learn when you begin working with React is that you shouldnâ€™t mutate or modify a list:

```javascript
// This is bad, push modifies the original array
items.push(newItem);
// This is good, concat doesnâ€™t modify the original array
const newItems = items.concat([newItem]);
```
Despite popular belief, thereâ€™s actually nothing wrong with mutating objects. In certain situations, like concurrency, it can become a problem, however, mutating objects is the easiest development approach. Just like most things in programming, itâ€™s a trade-off.

Functional programming and concepts like immutability are popular topics. But in the case of React, immutability isnâ€™t just fashionable, it has some real benefits. In this article, weâ€™ll explore immutability in React, covering what it is and how it works. Letâ€™s get started!

## <b>What is immutability?ðŸŸ </b>

If something is immutable, we cannot change its value or state. Although this may seem like a simple concept, as usual, the devil is in the details.

You can find immutable types in JavaScript itself; the String value type is a good example. If you define a string as follows, you cannot change a character of the string directly:

```javascript
var str = 'abc';
```
In JavaScript, strings are not arrays, so you can define one as follows:

```javascript
str[2] = 'd';
```
Defining a string using the method below assigns a different string to str:
```javascript
str = 'abd';
```
You can even define the str reference as a constant:
```javascript
const str = 'abc'
```
Therefore, assigning a new string generates an error. However, this doesnâ€™t relate to immutability. If you want to modify the string value, you have to use manipulation methods like <code>replace()</code>, <code>toUpperCase()</code>, or <code>trim()</code>. All of these methods return new strings; they donâ€™t modify the original one.

## <b>Value typeðŸŸ£</b>

Itâ€™s important to pay attention to the value type. String values are immutable, but string objects are not.

```javascript
const str = new String("abc");
str.myNewProperty = "some value";

alert(str.myNewProperty);

str.myNewProperty = "a new value";

alert(str.myNewProperty);
```
Strings are immutable. The last example creates an object with the String() constructor that wraps the immutable string value. You can add new properties to this wrapper because itâ€™s an object, and itâ€™s not frozen. This example leads us to a concept that is important to understand; the difference between reference and value equality.

## <b>Reference equality vs. value equalityðŸŸ¢</b>

With reference equality, you compare object references with either the <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code> operators or the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators. If the references point to the same object, they are considered equal:

```javascript
var str1 = â€˜abcâ€™;
var str2 = str1;
str1 === str2 // true
```
In the example above, both the <code>str1</code> and <code>str2</code>references are equal because they point to the same object, <code>'abc'</code>:
