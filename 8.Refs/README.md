# React refs ðŸ–‡

As is the case with many other UI libraries, React offers a way to rethink a view as the result of a state of a component. This is a big pivot away from how we usually build applications.

When we become familiar with some of these new concepts, we discover how easy it is to solve simple problems in the frontend world that used to cause us some trouble. Part of that benefit comes from creating views with the abstraction mechanisms that React and JSX expose, instead of doing it through DOM spec methods.
